Yet another RPG mod ! 

Started it one day ago so don't expect much 
Basic XP and level up 
Gain hp, mana , and damage as you level up 

Webpage link to discord since I still dont have terraria forum post for now


Changelog :

Tried to balance a bit the expert mode ( roughly halved Ennemy level and reduced boss level)
Each time you kill a new boss, weakest ennemy will gain level , also when you enter hardmode (not tested)
Healing item will heal more than displayed (will have to find a fix later on) based on your Health per Heart
